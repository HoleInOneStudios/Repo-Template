# Repo-Template

This a template for new repos.

> The repos that use this template may not look like this because this template has had many revisions, and not everything here is needed or I found out later it was redundant. I also will not go around updating each repo everytime this template is changed because I don't have the time or the effort to do that.

## Folder Structure

- `/`: Here is all the stuff that is required to be in the root (i.e. README.md, gitignore, and my workspace file)
- `/src`: All the source of project goes in here. When I build is to be done it will just look in here.
- `/docs`: By default it does have a workflow that sets it up as a page, but it still might need to be configured in the settings.
- `/.github`: Here is GitHubs stuff. (i.e. workflows, templates, configs, etc.)

## Workflows

- Greetings
- Labels
- Pages
- Stale
